subtitle: ''I really think that since I have no clue, everything is possible''

My name is Vince Doyo, and I graduated from the University of Sheffield. I figured I might as well create a website as some sort of archive to keep a record of my progress. 

I enjoy working on challenging problems that positively affect individuals or organisations. I am always open to trying new methods and ideas as I believe that new perspectives can develop understanding and knowledge.

In addition to my work, I will also include my side and passion projects ranging from coding to art and music!
