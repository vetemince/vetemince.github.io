My name is Vince Doyo and I am a graduate from the Universitt of Sheffield. I am looking to enter the data analytics field and figured I might as well create a website as some sort of archive - both for me and you (mostly me). I want this to seem as humman as possible - not sure how yet but hey-ho.

**Quick fire of things that I have done recently (as of 31/08/22)**
- Graduated the University of Sheffield with a degree in Accounting and Financial Management
- Completed an Internship with The Glass-House Community Led Design - blog post coming soon

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
