This blog aims to look at what I learned from my time with The Glass-House - focusing on skills that are transferable and will help me progress through my career.

If you want to know more about how the workshop went, Jake wrote an excellent piece about our [State of Play workshop!](https://theglasshouse.org.uk/co-design-collaboration/the-state-of-play-workshop-a-design-and-gaming-workshop-at-the-national-videogame-museum/)
I also a reflective blog post about my time with The Glass-House team. (Link provided when blog is published).
